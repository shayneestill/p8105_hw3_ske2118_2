```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

The ny_noaa dataset has 2,595176 rows and 7 columns. The variables include id(chr), date(date), prcp(int), snow(int), snwd(int), tmax(chr), and tmin(chr). There is a significant amount of missing data in all columns. 

Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?
