The ny_noaa dataset has 2,595176 rows and 7 columns. The variables
include id(chr), date(date), prcp(int), snow(int), snwd(int), tmax(chr),
and tmin(chr). There is a significant amount of missing data in all
columns.

Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly
observed values? Why?
